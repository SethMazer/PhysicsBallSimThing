# What is this?

Hello, this is just my first attempt at learning not only a graphical library for C, but 
3D vector space, and implementing functional physics to programming. Although I've made physics calculators the past, those are just that, calculators. 

This is my attempt at taking my physics knowledge and applying it to a 3D world. All this is,
is creating a Ball, and when you press P, you throw the ball and its supposed to abide by
the laws of physics.

# Will this be updated?

Most likely not, If it is, it would be used as a testing world, for another project. I simply
wanted to see if I could add 3D graphics, and physics to a world and I did, so that's really it
for this thing.

# Why did you post it then?

Idk I just wanted to post it to show the few people who sees this what my first intro to 3d space was in coding

If its still pinned its probably because A. Its the latest I've done in "3D coding" or B. I've started working on the main project and its just not ready to overtake the pin.
