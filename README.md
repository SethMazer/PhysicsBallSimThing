# What is this?

Hello, this is just my first attempt at learning not only a graphical library for C, but 
3D vector space, and implementing functional physics to programming. Although I've made physics calculators the past, those are just that, calculators. 

This is my attempt at taking my physics knowledge and applying it to a 3D world. All this is,
is creating a Ball, and when you press P, you throw the ball and its supposed to abide by
the laws of physics.

# Will this be updated?

Most likely not, If it is, it would be used as a testing world, for another project. I simply
wanted to see if I could add 3D graphics, and physics to a world and I did, so that's really it
for this thing. If its still pinned its probably because A. Its the latest I've done in "3D coding" or B. I've 
started working on the main project and its just not ready to overtake the pin.

# Are you aware that it only works in "one direction"

Yes I am aware that the ball only gets thrown in one direction relative to the camera, in fact in order to get the gif for below, 
I had to spawn the ball then walk around to the side to capture the throw, since yk, it only works in one direction

Why does it look choppy? Idk the recording software Ig, and the text isnt in world, its just edited on
